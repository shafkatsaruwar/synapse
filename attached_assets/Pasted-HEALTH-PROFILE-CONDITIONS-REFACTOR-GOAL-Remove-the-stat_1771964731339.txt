HEALTH PROFILE – CONDITIONS (REFACTOR)

GOAL:
Remove the static preset “Conditions” chip list from Settings and replace it with a dynamic, searchable, user-managed Conditions system.

CHANGES:

1) REMOVE OLD UI
- Delete the preset chip grid for conditions from Settings.
- Conditions should no longer be selectable from onboarding.

2) NEW NAVIGATION STRUCTURE
Settings → Health Profile → Conditions

Create a new screen: HealthProfileConditionsScreen

3) CONDITIONS SCREEN UI

If user has no conditions:
- Show empty state text: “No conditions added”
- Show primary button: “+ Add Condition”

If user has conditions:
- Show them as a vertical list (not chips)
  Each item:
    • Condition name
    • Optional notes indicator
    • Edit / Delete action

Floating or bottom button:
+ Add Condition

4) ADD CONDITION FLOW

On tap “Add Condition”:
Open a modal with:

A) Search input at top
Placeholder: “Search conditions”

B) Search results list (from local dataset for now)

C) “Add custom condition” option when no exact match

Selecting a condition saves it to the user profile.

5) DATA SOURCE (PHASE 1 – LOCAL)

Create a local JSON dataset:
conditions.json

Structure:
[
  {
    "id": "icd_xxxxx",
    "name": "Culler-Jones Syndrome"
  },
  {
    "id": "icd_xxxxx",
    "name": "Hypothyroidism"
  }
]

This will simulate WHO / ICD data for now.

6) SAVED CONDITION DATA MODEL

Each saved condition should store:

{
  id: string
  name: string
  source: "database" | "custom"
  dateAdded: timestamp
  notes?: string
  requiresStressDose?: boolean
}

7) AFTER USER SELECTS A CONDITION

If this is a new condition:
Ask:

“Does this condition require stress dosing when you are sick?”

Toggle:
Yes / No

Save this value in the condition object.

8) EDIT CONDITION

User can:
- Add / edit notes
- Toggle stress dose requirement
- Delete condition

9) STORAGE

Persist conditions in the same storage system used for:
medications / symptoms (AsyncStorage or current state store).

Create:
healthProfile.conditions

10) FUTURE READY

Keep search logic abstracted so the local JSON can later be replaced by a real WHO / ICD API without changing UI.

11) ACCESSIBILITY

- All buttons minimum height 44px
- Support dynamic text
- Screen reader labels for:
  Add Condition
  Edit Condition
  Delete Condition
  Stress dose toggle

OUT OF SCOPE (DO NOT IMPLEMENT NOW):
- API integration
- AI parsing
- Condition-based analytics
